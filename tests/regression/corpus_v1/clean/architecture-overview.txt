This document outlines the three-layer architecture for the chat gateway service.
Requests enter through the API tier, are validated by a policy engine, and then
pass to the generation backend. Each layer publishes metrics and logs, but there
are no shell commands or secrets in this overview. Configuration is driven by
YAML files checked into the repo, and deployments use blue/green rollouts.
